# custom-commit-snippets

This VSCode extension adds snippets for your commit messages.

Snippets presets (like [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) and [Conventional Commit](https://conventionalcommits.org)) are included, but you can easily edit them or create your own snippets.

## Settings

* *`customCommitSnippets.activeFile`*: Select the active snippets file. Prefer the `customCommitSnippets.selectFile` command to change it.
* *`customCommitSnippets.scopeVariants`*: Enable/disable scope variants of each snippet (e.g. `feat:` and `feat():`).
